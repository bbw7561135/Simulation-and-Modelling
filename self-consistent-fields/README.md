## hartree_fock

A simulation of a H-H+ molecule using the Hartree-Fock method. The energy of the molecule is printed to screen.

## hartree_fock_water

A simulation of a water molecule using the Hartree-Fock method. The plots of the molecular orbits are plotted for the 1s, 2s and 2p orbitals for the oxygen and hydrogen atoms. The STO-3G function basis is used to construct the molecular orbitals.

## test_HF

Pytest style 'unit tests' for hartree_flock_water.
