# monte-carlo

## ising_model

Simulation of a system of spins using the Ising model. The system is a 2D square lattice evolved in time by using the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm to randomly sample the system using Monte Carlo techniques. The code attempts to find an equilibrium state of the system at varying grid sizes and temperatures before it calculates the final magnetisation of the system.

## lennard_jones_fluid

WIP: Simulates a gas using the Lennard-Jones potential. Calculates the pressure of the gas after being evolved in time in the NVT ensemble.

## mc_int

An n-dimensional generalisation of mc_int_circle_sphere to calculate the volume of an n-dimensional hypersphere using Monte Carlo integration.

## mc_int_circle_sphere

Calculates the area and volume of a sphere using Monte Carlo integration.

## metropolis-hastings

An application of the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm to calculate the ground state energy of particles in a box.
