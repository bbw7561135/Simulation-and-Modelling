# Simulation and Modelling

Python scripts developed as part of the FEEG6016 Simulation and Modelling module at the University of Southampton.

## Agents

Examples of cellular automata and agent based simulation techniques. Includes Conway's Game of Life and a simulations of a single lane road and a flock of birds.

## Assignment Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks of submitted coursework.

## Finite Element

Example of 1D and 2D finite element algorithms used to solve the heat equation.

## Molecular Dynamics

Examples of using Newton's law to simulate the dynamics of molecules with different potential energy functions.

## Monte Carlo

Examples of basic Monte Carlo integration algorithms and Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithms. The Metropolis algorithm is used to solve the Ising Model for a simple 2D system.

## Self Consistent Fields

The Hartree-Fock method to solve a self consistent field system. Used to calculate the (incorrect) molecular orbits of a water molecule.

## Stochastic Differential Equations

Examples of algorithms used to solve stochastic differential equations. Particular focus is placed on the Euler-Maruyama and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck methods.
